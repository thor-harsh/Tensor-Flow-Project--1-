**In this project we'll be solving the regression problem. Here we will finding the total medical cost for a person based on different features using TensorFlow..** <br></br>

**Before jumping to the code lets understand what is TensorFlow and What do you mean by regression problem?**...<br></br>

**Let's looks into dataset and features of it:** <br>

**About Dataset**: <br>

Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz is a book that provides an introduction to machine learning using R. As far as I can tell, Packt Publishing does not make its datasets available online unless you buy the book and create a user account which can be a problem if you are checking the book out from the library or borrowing the book from a friend. All of these datasets are in the public domain but simply needed some cleaning up and recoding to match the format in the book. <br>

**Features**: age,sex,bmi,children,smoker,region <br></br>
**Label/Target Vector** : charges <br></br>

**Columns**: <br></br>

age: age of primary beneficiary <br>

sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male <br>

bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9 <br>

children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents <br>

smoker: Smoking <br>

region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest. <br>

charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance. <br></br>

**What is a TensorFlow?** <br></br>

TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks. It was developed by the Google Brain team for Google's internal use in research and production. <br></br>

**What is a Regression?** <br></br>

Regression is a statistical method used in finance, investing, and other disciplines that attempts to determine the strength and character of the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Linear regression is the most common form of this technique. <br></br>
