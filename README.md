**In this project we'll be solving the regression problem. Here we will finding the total medical cost for a person based on different features using TensorFlow** <br></br>

**Before jumping to the code lets understand what is TensorFlow and What do you mean by regression problem?**...<br></br>

Let's looks into dataset and features of it:

Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz is a book that provides an introduction to machine learning using R. As far as I can tell, Packt Publishing does not make its datasets available online unless you buy the book and create a user account which can be a problem if you are checking the book out from the library or borrowing the book from a friend. All of these datasets are in the public domain but simply needed some cleaning up and recoding to match the format in the book.

**What is a TensorFlow?**

TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks. It was developed by the Google Brain team for Google's internal use in research and production. 

**What is a Regression?**

Regression is a statistical method used in finance, investing, and other disciplines that attempts to determine the strength and character of the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Linear regression is the most common form of this technique.
